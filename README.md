# Data Science-based Optimisation (dascop)

This project aims to develop an approach based on, but not limited to, Data Science and Optimisation for solving continuous optimisation problems. As a final product, engineers and academicians can dispose of a framework for generating and/or selecting tailored metaheuristics these problems, closely related to practical engineering problems.

## Outline




Therefore, let HH be a technique that solves
\[(\mathbf{h}_*;\vec{x}_*) = \underset{\mathbf{h}\in\mathfrak{H}^n,\vec{x}\in\mathfrak{X}}{\arg\max}\{F(\mathbf{h}|\mathfrak{X})\}.\]
In other words, a HH searches for the optimal heuristic configuration
\(\mathbf{h}_*\) that produces the optimal solution \(\vec{x}_*\) with
the maximal performance \(F(\mathbf{h}_*|\mathfrak{X})\).


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
