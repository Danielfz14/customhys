# Data Science-based Optimisation (dascop)

This project aims to develop an approach based on, but not limited to, Data Science and Optimisation for solving continuous optimisation problems. As a final product, engineers and academicians can dispose of a framework for generating and/or selecting tailored metaheuristics these problems, closely related to practical engineering problems.

## Tasks

- [x] Collect metaheuristics and extract their search operators (SOs).
- [x] Collect benchmark functions (BFs) for continuous optimisation.
- [x] Build the optimisation framework.
- [x] Test this framework with the chosen SOs and BFs as a primary study.



- [ ] Test the search operators collection generating a 1-cardinality metaheuristic for each one

- [ ] this is an incomplete item





### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
